# _Amos Tarot APP_

### Description

**Amos Tarot** is an online tarot reading platform that allows users to receive tarot card readings. It is based on a project by [William Kulha](https://github.com/WilliamKulha/tarot). This version enhances the user experience by providing a modern design, a responsive interface for mobile and desktop, and additional features for tarot enthusiasts.

The app currently supports three tarot spreads using the Rider-Waite deck, which is in the public domain. Each card comes with its description, and users can explore detailed meanings through links to Biddy Tarot. Every card has a 50/50 chance of being drawn right-side-up or reversed by default.

Future updates will introduce more tarot spreads and additional decks to offer users even more options.
